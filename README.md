Personal website made with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [@next/mdx](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/mdx).

Using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) in this version as an experiment.

Currently deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) with their managed Next.js hosting, but can be quickly re-deployed on a cloud VM or in a static object storage (with few changes).
