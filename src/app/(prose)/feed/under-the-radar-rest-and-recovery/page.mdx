> Rest for me is focusing on other parts of life that I care about: family, travel, and health.

> Work feels like it has higher immediate consequences, which is why it gets more attention.

> Burnout is not a state, an indicator on the "dashboard". It's a slope: if the slope goes downwards, you're in a bad place.

> The reality of rest is you don't know how much you needed it until you take it.

> I have to force myself to rest because, otherwise, I'm ultimately unable to deliver my best work.

> We're burning ourselves out doing things that we realistically don't even need to be doing.
