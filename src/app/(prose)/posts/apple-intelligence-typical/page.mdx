Apple is at it again. Just when you thought they couldn't get more Apple-y, they decide that AI doesn't mean Artificial Intelligence anymore: from now on, it's Apple Intelligence. Because of course it is.

They've got a history of doing this. Remember when "Retina" was just an eye thing? Apple turned it into a (damn good) display feature. Now they're doing the same with AI. Typical.

It's all about saying, "Our AI isn't like the others. It's Apple-branded." They can't resist taking a buzzword and slapping their logo on it. So while everyone else is talking about Artificial Intelligence, Apple is all about making it their own.

It's the ultimate Apple move: take something everyone's already talking about, give it an Apple twist, and call it a day. And you know what's the worst thing? I'll try it, and I'll probably like it. So here's to Apple Intelligence.
