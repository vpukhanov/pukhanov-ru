Ginkgo does not collect, store, or share any personal data.

The app works entirely offline and does not access the internet. It does not require any permissions and does not use analytics or trackers.

All PDF files are opened using the system file picker or passed from other apps, and are rendered locally. Ginkgo does not access or retain any document content outside of the active viewing session.

If you have any questions or concerns, you may contact the developer at [vyacheslav@pukhanov.ru](mailto:vyacheslav@pukhanov.ru).
